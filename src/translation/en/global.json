        "Sect5_archipel_description2": "Nosy Iranja consists of two islets: Nosy Iranja Be and Nosy Iranja Kely. They are connected by an immaculate 2 km white sandbank. The scenery is breathtaking – turquoise waters, a local village, a stunning viewpoint and a 19th-century lighthouse. Nosy Iranja lies about 48 km from Nosy Be.",
        "Sect5_archipel_description3": "Since October 2011 this uninhabited island has been a protected area. It is home only to lemurs (they live freely but often approach people as they are accustomed to tourists).",
        "Sect5_archipel_description4": "Nosy Komba (the island of lemurs), also known as “Nosy Ambariovato” meaning “island surrounded by rocks”, is a volcanic island 7 km from Hell-Ville, northwest of Madagascar. With its evergreen rainforest it hosts unique flora and fauna. It’s one of the best places to observe lemurs. About 8,000 inhabitants live from embroidery, fishing and various crops (vanilla, yam, cocoa, etc.).",
        "Sect5_archipel_description5": "Nosy Tanikely, meaning “small land island”, is an uninhabited islet declared a marine nature reserve. With abundant coral reefs and exceptional biodiversity, the reserve shelters many marine species. Access to the island is regulated. The reserve covers a 700-meter radius around the lighthouse. This “natural aquarium” is perfect for snorkeling lovers.",
        "Sect5_archipel_description6": "Off the west coast of Nosy Be lies Nosy Sakatia, a small peaceful island known as the Island of Orchids. Around 600 inhabitants live there. The island offers excellent diving spots and is home to turtles. Its charm also lies in its forest trails where you can encounter wild orchids, bats, chameleons and other species. Nosy Sakatia is about a 10-minute motorboat ride from Nosy Be.",
        "Sect5_archipel_description7": "Nosy Be is home to the protected primary forest called Lokobe, often visited by scientists. It is full of centuries-old trees and endemic medicinal plants. This preserved habitat shelters many lemurs (Macaco and Lepilemur), reptiles, chameleons, insects and tropical birds. The 740-hectare reserve covers most of the island’s endemic vegetation – an ideal place for nature lovers.",
